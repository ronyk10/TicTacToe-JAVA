## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## TicTacToe

This is my first Java project, it aims to recreate the famous Tic Tac Toe game, while learning the language, i've been watching tutorials to reach my goal. It was very satisfying to play it after, with some friends. The "I made this" feeling is very pleasing and as a beginner, I liked it alot.
